# AnomalyDetectionSolarPower
The world scenario of energy sustainability is witnessing a high growth of solar
photovoltaic (PV) being perhaps the most promising renewable energy and about to
become the largest source of electricity in the world by 2050. However, several
anomalous factors negatively influence efficiency. of PV panels. With this, fault
detection systems help in the operation and maintenance of energy efficiency. Given
this scenario, this research aimed to propose an unsupervised anomaly detection
model using LSTM and Autoencoder based on the forecast reconstruction error and
the actual measured value. The results revealed that the model using all data with a
time window of 32 for 1 hour ahead forecast obtained the best result to find operation
failures in the period.
